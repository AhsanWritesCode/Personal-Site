                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I’m a Computer Science (Honours) student at the University of Calgary with a deep interest in software development, research, and building meaningful technology.

                    Currently, I’m developing an Apple Vision Pro application simulating vision impairments using Swift and ARKit as part of an undergraduate research project funded by Alberta Innovates. I’ve also built full-stack applications using technologies like React, Node.js, and AWS, and I’m especially excited by projects that combine technical challenge with social impact.
                    
                    <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                    Before transitioning into tech, I completed a diploma in Civil Engineering Technology at SAIT. This foundation honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, which now strengthen my approach to technical projects and research.
                    
                    <h2>Leadership and Volunteering</h2>
                    I enjoy leading initiatives that support others: as VP External for the UCalgary Competitive Programming Club, I’ve helped organize weekly algorithm tutorials, secured thousands in sponsorships, and connected peers to research opportunities. Outside of academics, I continue to volunteer with the Alberta Children’s Hospital and bring empathy and energy to every space I’m part of.
                    
                    <h2>Collaboration and Opportunities</h2>
                    Feel free to reach out about collaboration, opportunities, or just to connect; I’m always open to thoughtful conversations and new ideas.</p>
